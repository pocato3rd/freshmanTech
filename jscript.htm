     <h3>About My Program</h3>
     <p1>&nbsp &nbsp My program, 'School of Mages' is a javascript choice based game. The user goes through the different stages of the game choosing answers. If the the answer is wrong, they'll be told "Game Over" and cannot continue from that point. There are several questions where there is no right or wrong answer, simply a choice of what the user wants. However, these choices affect the game later in. My game code is about 687 lines of code. It took me around three or four days to completely flesh out and complete this game. Now what you, being the user, are waiting for, the game:</p1>

You rush inside.<br><br>As you walk across the last step into the TEMPLE, braziers catch fire in a circular pattern, they light up the room. It is more like a tower than a room. The ceiling reaches into the darkness and the soft glow of the fire reflects off of the water that fills up who knows how much of the room below your feet. The water is still. with a small spire protruding in the middle. You look to your left and find another puzzle plaque, 'You must choose us in order of when we speak. I am at the bottom, I fight to no avail to my uppers. I am the almighty that watches these calm waters. I prey on the first, but fear the second. Step on our switches to choose.' You look forward and see three symbols inprinted on the floor: a HAWK, a PLANKTON, and a FISH. In which order do you step on the switches?</p>

        <p class="story" id="weaponTempleQ">As you step on FISH, gears behind the walls turn. The water drains, revealing stairs leading down into a dark archway. You push on. As you pass the archway. The braziers wink out, plunging you into darkness. A door falls shut behind you. Putting your ear to the door, you hear the flow of water, it's dry as you put your hand to the creases. You continue deeper into the TEMPLE. You walk into a cavern bathed in light. The room is circular. A single bridge leads to a middle platform surrounded by water. You walk onto the bridge to the center of the platform. Your foot falls onto a switch. Gears turn and the bridge crashes into the water. Leaving you on the platform. A low rumble causes more ripples in the water. Fins emerge from the water and then a giant snake bursts out of the water. It's eyes watch you. Do you use your element or do you use the sword on your hip?</p>
