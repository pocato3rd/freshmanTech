        <h3>About Pennfield</h3>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Pennfield has two different wings. One where the classrooms are, the other is where the cafeteria, auditorium, band/choir, and gym are. In the classroom wing there are two floors, with two halls on each floor. On the first floor are the Senior and Junior hallways and on the second are the Freshman and Sophmore hallways. They're organized by colors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="green">Senior - most of the art classes are in this hall</li>
          <li id="yellow">Junior - most of the science (including social science) classes are in this hall</li>
          <li id="red">Sophmore - most of the math classes are in this hall</li>
          <li id="blue">Freshman - most of the English classes are in this hall</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp At Pennfield, each student in Middle School and High School has a Chromebook. In the Middle School the students keep their Chromebooks at the school. However, in the High School, students take their Chromebooks home. Virtually every assignment we do is online. Many students waste their time browsing through social media sites instead of doing the assignments. Personally, I believe that we shouldn't use computers as often as we do, we should use pencil and paper. On the computer, many copy and paste or use Google, I don't understand how we are supposed to learn when we can easily copy and paste and get our work done. Constant computer usage at school isn't very efficient.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Every Tuesday and Thursday are seminar days, meaning there's an extra class between 3rd hour and lunch. It's practically a period to just catch up on late or missing work to my understanding. Seminar shifts the time of all the classes.</p>
