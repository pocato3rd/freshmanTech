        <h3>About BCAMSC</h3>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp The Battle Creek Area Math and Science Center is a high school like no other. The three-floored building was designed by staff and students. In most high schools one will see host hall after hall of lockers. However, at the Center there are no lockers, nor halls for that matter. When I joined the Center I was told that a trusting community thrives inside. Coming from Pennfield, where people steal the simplest things like pencils for the fun of it, I didn't believe in a 'trusting community' where I could leave my bag and computer out in the commons and expect no one to touch it. However, over the school year I've seen that yes, the community at the Center is a trusting community.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp There are 18 different schools that attend the Math and Science Center. Of course our homeschools have rivalries and at first it showed. As the first month progressed, the homeschool rivalries faded. There's always competition, but the competition is amongst ourselves and our peers, not amongst a rival school. Anyone who looks inside the Center now won't see different schools being represented inside the Center, but will see a group of supportive students that are proud to be in the fleet of Phoenix.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Each day the students ride from their homeschool to the Center. At the Center there are two periods with 25 minutes inbetween. Mondays and Thursdays there are announcements during break in the Duncan Wing on the first floor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First period goes from 7:40 am to 9:00 am
                <li>Break goes from 9:00 am to 9:25 am
                <li>Second period goes from 9:25 am to 10:45 am
            </ul>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Wednesdays, during break, popcorn is sold for 50 cents per bag. On Friday mornings, students and staff can purchase a donut from Sweetwaters Donut Mill for one dollar.</p>

        <img id = "scCas" src="images/exponx.png" alt="Screen Shot of program from CAS"/>
	<p id ="right">&nbsp &nbsp At the Math and Science Center, each student has a TI-Nspire CX CAS. This is an advanced calculator that can do a wide range of tasks like Algebra, Probability, Calculus, graphing, storing data, drawing, and even programming. The CAS has much more to offer than just those few things. To the left you'll see a screen shot fom my CAS while on a program page. This program takes in an initial value, exponential rate, and the value to get to. Using this collected information the program calculates the exponent that fits and then graphs the function: initial value multiplied by the exponential rate raised to the value the program finds. This is just one example of a CAS program written in BASIC. Creating a program is useful when we want to do a process alot, but the process is too long for it to be appealing to type over and over again.
	<br><br>
	&nbsp &nbsp Programming on our CAS' was just one of the many things we did in Freshman Technology. We also learned the history of computing and how computers function, programming pages, working in terminals, and working with spreadsheets and word processors.</p>
