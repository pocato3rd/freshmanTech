          <h3>Our Requirments and What I Did</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp This website was programmed using eMacs on the Terminal. It was created for my Freshman Technology class at the Batle Creek Area Math and Science Center. We are to create a website that portrays what we've learned in class. The three main languages we learned to make a website like the one you see before you are <i>Hyper Text Markup Language 5</i>, <i>Cascading Stylesheets</i>, and <i>Javascript</i>. We put our knowledge of these three languages together to create a website that works and flows properly.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp We were required to create 4 different pages:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>a home page, which you see before you,</li>
	    <li>a summary of the BCAMSC,</li>
	    <li>a summary of our home schools, mine being Pennfield,</li>
	    <li>a working Javascript page, and</li>
	    <li>I added another Javascript page as well</li>
        <li>I had time and was bored, so I added yet another Javascript page</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp In addition to these HTML pages, we were required to make a stylesheet that links to the pages. I actually created 8 different stylesheets that link throughout my website.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>techsite.css - This is the overarcing stylesheet</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>index.css - The stylesheet linked to my home page</li>
	      <li>bcamsc.css - The stylesheet linked to my BCAMSC summary</li>
	      <li>penn.css - The stylesheet linked to my Pennfield Summary</li>
	      <li>jscript.css - The stylesheet linked to my Javascript page.</li>
	      <li>carousel.css - This stylesheet is <i>also</i> linked to my Javascript page, it allows my code screenshots to scroll.</li>
	      <li>draw.css - This stylesheet links to my second Javacript page</li>
	      <li>dropdown.css - This stylesheet is <i>also</i> linked to my second Javascript. It allows the dropdown menus to work</li>
           <li>space.css - This stylesheet is linked to my third Javascript page.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </ul>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp One of the requirements for our website was an ease of naviagtion between the different pages. Knowing this, I created the slide out menu at the top left. This menu uses jQuery and Javascript to slide out on click. Using if statements, the jQuery understands how to change the body and position of the bar. The code for this simple change took me a little over an hour to debug and correct.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp We were given minimum requirements for the different HTML elements we add to our page. This includes, but wasn't limited to: lists, tables, GIFs, button, and font sizes.</p>
	  <h3>My Difficulties</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp I had the most difficulty with the first working Javascript element. It was a complex tree of choices that I had to keep track of. I ran <i>many</i> tests to make sure it worked and it being more 600+ lines of code, things didn't work so well for a long time. Most of my errors were missing a semi-colon or a simple misspelling. However, when things did work, I became estatic. I ended up overcoming each challenge and I am very proud of how it turned out.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp Also on my first Javascript page, I had tried to make the screenshots of my code fade in and out like some online carousels. I got the first picture to fade into the next, but after that I couldn't get any further. I even tried to look at some other carousel code, but yet again, I couldn't decipher how it should work. After much frustration, I decided I would change it to what it is now, a box that has a set height that the pictures reside in.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp On my second Javascript page I had a quite a bit of trouble doing mainly two things: Having the page understand when the mouse is being held and dragged and making the dropdowns. The page greatly utilizes these two events and it took me awhile to figure out.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp Another difficulty I had was actually writing the text for the page you're on now, my Home page. At first I thought I'd make it about myself, but I'm not very good at talking about myself. I actually wasted an entire day thinking of what to write. However, I finally decided to write the different requirements we had and how I achieved those requirements.</p>
	  <h3>What I Breezed Through</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp Once I decided to change from a carousel to just scrolling, it was really easy for me to write the code. Another thing that was really easy was writing the description for my Javascript element.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp I built a majority of my second Javascript page within a day. It was fairly easy to get the dots created on click, change dot colors, change dot size, change the background color, and make a reset button. Most of it, I had learned before.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp &nbsp I breezed through writing the entirity of my summary page for the Battle Creek Area Math and Science Center. Describing this place was an easy task and most of the tags and attributes I used I had already memorized. I had some difficulty starting my Pennfield summary, but once I started, it became extremely easy and I was finished before I had even realized.</p>
